# GettingAndCleaningData-course-project
this is the course project repo of my "GettingAndCleaningData" coursera course.
the "run_analysis.R" is my script for performing the analysis to the data of "UCI HAR Dataset".
the"codebook.md" is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

In the script,I did this four step:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

And after analysis,I create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

ps:I am not so sure how to write the CodeBook.md file. So I just write down the variable name in this analysis process.
